    "By definition, a __calendar spread__ is a spread trade involving the simultaneous the purchase of an option expiring at a maturity and sales of the same instrument expiring at another maturity. Theoretically speaking, if market conditions are foreseeably constant (i.e. forward price, and volatility), for two option contracts whose contract features are exactly the same (i.e. call/put, strike) and only their maturities are different, the option with longer maturity is expected to be more expensive than the option with shorter maturity. This is because, while the shorter maturity option reaches expiry, the longer maturity option are still alive, and its Time Value gives it extra benefit on top of the payoff."
